==============================
We will use the new "Store in Mind" technology for the iPhone. There is one catch. We need to store the serial numbers of the coins. 
There will be three PNGs that will act as databases for the serial numbers and they will use the PNG file format.

Files include:
1. cloudcoin.bank.png
2. cloudcoin.counterfeit.png
3. cloudcoin.fracked.png
4. cloudcoin.limbo.png
