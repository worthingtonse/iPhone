# Picture Password System

The iPhone App will be the first CloudCoin program that will not store CloudCoin Authenticity Numbers in files. Instead it will only store Serial Numbers
and they will all be stored in one PNG file. 

When coins are POWNed, the ANs will be created based on the user's password. For this reason, we will use a new technique to create very strong passwords that can be remembered using new memory techniques. 

To increase the security, the login will use a combination of pictograms and a traditional password. The first part of the password will be generated by random. The second part of the password will be choosen by the user. 

## Graphics Password

The first time the user uses the program, the system will generate a story for the user using the following logic.

```
"There once was a _(character)__ who was _(verb)_ near a _(place)_ when a magic _(thing)_ appeared. When the _(Character)_ _(verb)_ it, it caused a _(event)_"

Samples:
There once was a viking who was digging near a zoo when a magic chicken appeared. When the Viking studied it, it caused a Ice Age.

There once was a Robot who was talking near a theater when a magic flashlight appeared. When the robot poked it, it caused a time warp.

There once was a Farmer who was drinking near a museum when a magic necklass appeared. When the farmer sat on it, it caused a Fire.
```

There will be six screens that the user will need to go through to log into the program along with a password at the end.


The user will be shown a screen with 32 icons on it. Each icon will have a position of 1 through 32. Each postion shall have its own color and the icon shall be of that color. 

 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
---|---|---|---
5 | 6| 7| 8
9| 10| 11 | 12
13 | 14| 15| 16

==============================
We will use the new "Store in Mind" technology for the iPhone. There is one catch. We need to store the serial numbers of the coins. 
There will be three PNGs that will act as databases for the serial numbers and they will use the PNG file format.

Files include:
1. cloudcoin.bank.png
2. cloudcoin.counterfeit.png
3. cloudcoin.fracked.png
4. cloudcoin.limbo.png
